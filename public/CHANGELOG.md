## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Player State Synchronization

- **Pause Button Not Working**: Fixed infinite play/pause loop caused by React state being out of sync with audio element state
  - Root cause: useEffect dependency on `isPlaying` triggered when user paused, causing immediate auto-play
  - Solution: Removed `isPlaying` from dependency array and eliminated auto-play for already-loaded tracks
  - Added polling mechanism (500ms) to sync React state with actual audio element state
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:694-711` - togglePlay checks actual audio state
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1080` - Removed isPlaying from dependency array
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1084-1096` - Added state sync polling

#### Visualizer Animation Lifecycle

- **Visualizer Not Responding to Play/Pause**: Fixed animation loop not starting/stopping with playback
  - Root cause: Animation loop only triggered on audioElement changes, not play/pause state changes
  - Solution: Added play/pause event listeners to track audio state and trigger animation loop
  - Animation now properly starts when playing and stops when paused
  - Locations:
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:32-57` - Added play/pause event listeners
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:150-154` - Animation loop depends on isPlaying state
    - `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx:294-297` - Fixed prop mismatch (audioElement vs analyser/audioContext)

#### Browser Autoplay Policy Compliance

- **NotAllowedError on Page Load**: Fixed browser blocking audio autoplay on initial page load
  - Solution: Skip auto-play on first render when restoring queue from localStorage
  - User must explicitly click play or select a song for audio to start
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1052-1056` - Skip auto-play on initial mount
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:112-122` - Initialize audio source without playing

### Technical Details

**State Synchronization Architecture:**

- Audio element's `.paused` property is now the source of truth
- React `isPlaying` state synced via:
  1. Audio element event listeners (play/pause events)
  2. Polling fallback (500ms) to catch missed events
  3. Direct checks in togglePlay and visualizer
- UI button icons always match actual playback state

**Visualizer Event-Driven Updates:**

```
Audio Element Events → FlowFieldBackground State → Animation Loop
     play event      →   setIsPlaying(true)     →   Start animating
    pause event      →   setIsPlaying(false)    →   Stop animating
```

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` - State sync, autoplay prevention, pause button fix
- Modified: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx` - Event-driven animation, play/pause tracking
- Modified: `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx` - Fixed visualizer props

## [0.7.9] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Context Stability

- **Critical Audio Context Error**: Resolved `InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'createMediaElementSource'`
  - Fixed conflict where both equalizer and visualizer were creating separate MediaElementSource nodes
  - Browser limitation: Only ONE MediaElementSource allowed per HTMLMediaElement
  - Implemented shared audio graph architecture with single source node
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useEqualizer.ts:51,201-212,390-391` - Added analyser node to equalizer chain
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:8-13,15-23` - Simplified to use shared analyser
    - `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx:293-300` - Wired shared analyser between components

### Technical Details

**Previous Architecture (Broken):**

```
Audio Element → useEqualizer creates source → filters → destination
Audio Element → FlowFieldBackground creates source → analyser → destination
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                ERROR: Can't create 2nd source from same element!
```

**New Architecture (Fixed):**

```
Audio Element → useEqualizer creates ONE source → filters → analyser → destination
                                                              ↑
                                                 FlowFieldBackground uses this
```

**Audio Chain Flow:**

- Single `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` created in `useEqualizer`
- Connected through 9 equalizer filter nodes
- Flows to `AnalyserNode` (shared with visualizer)
- Finally connects to `AudioContext.destination` (speakers)
- When equalizer disabled: source connects directly to analyser (bypassing filters)

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates dual source node creation errors
- Maintains equalizer functionality (10-band EQ, presets)
- Preserves visualizer audio reactivity (flow field patterns)
- Cleaner architecture with single source of truth
- Proper resource cleanup on unmount

## [0.7.8] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Player Controls

- **Pause Button Reliability**: Enhanced pause functionality with proper error handling
  - Added audio element initialization check before pausing
  - Implemented try-catch error handling to prevent pause failures
  - Added logging to help diagnose playback issues
  - Ensures isPlaying state always syncs correctly with audio element
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:551-567`

- **Queue Clearing on Track End**: Fixed queue not clearing when single song finishes playing
  - When a track ends with no more tracks in queue, the queue is now properly cleared
  - Prevents stale track from remaining in queue after playback completes
  - Added logging to confirm queue clearing behavior
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:156-165`

### Technical Details

**Pause Function Enhancement:**

The pause function now includes comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
const pause = useCallback(() => {
  if (!audioRef.current) {
    console.warn("[useAudioPlayer] Cannot pause: audio element not initialized");
    setIsPlaying(false);
    return;
  }

  try {
    audioRef.current.pause();
    setIsPlaying(false);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[useAudioPlayer] Error pausing audio:", error);
    setIsPlaying(false);
  }
}, []);
```

**Queue Clearing Logic:**

When `handleTrackEnd()` is called with no remaining tracks in queue:

```typescript
} else {
  // No more tracks in queue, playback ends
  onTrackEnd?.(currentTrack);
  // Clear the queue since playback is complete
  setQueue([]);
  setIsPlaying(false);
  console.log("[useAudioPlayer] 🏁 Playback ended, queue cleared");
}
```

**Benefits:**

- More reliable pause/play toggling
- Cleaner queue state management
- Better user experience when playing single tracks
- Improved debugging with enhanced logging

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` (pause function + queue clearing logic)

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

#### Critical Audio Context Stability Issue

- **Visualizer Toggle Error Resolution**: Fixed critical `InvalidStateError` when toggling visualizer on/off
  - Root cause: HTMLAudioElement can only be connected to one MediaElementSourceNode (browser limitation)
  - When visualizer was toggled off and back on, component remounted and attempted to reconnect the same audio element
  - This caused `InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'createMediaElementSource'` errors requiring page reload
  - **Solution**: Implemented global WeakMap to track connected audio elements and reuse existing connections
  - Audio element connections now persist across component lifecycle changes
  - Visualizer can be toggled on/off without errors or page reloads
  - Location: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:27-70`

#### Profile Page Authentication Errors

- **UNAUTHORIZED Error Elimination**: Fixed excessive UNAUTHORIZED errors when viewing profile pages
  - Root cause: Track card components (`EnhancedTrackCard`, `TrackCard`, `Player`) were calling authenticated endpoints (`music.isFavorite`, `music.getPlaylists`) without checking authentication status
  - When viewing someone else's profile (or when not logged in), these queries were called and failed with UNAUTHORIZED
  - This caused hundreds of error logs and degraded performance
  - **Solution**: Added authentication checks using `useSession` hook before calling protected endpoints
  - Queries now only execute when user is authenticated
  - Eliminated all UNAUTHORIZED errors on public profile pages
  - Components gracefully handle unauthenticated state (favorite/playlist features simply unavailable)
  - Location: `src/components/EnhancedTrackCard.tsx:32-35, 59-61`
  - Location: `src/components/TrackCard.tsx:36-39, 63-65`
  - Location: `src/components/Player.tsx:85-88, 109-111`

### Changed

#### Pattern Controls Enhancement

- **Pattern Duration Range**: Increased maximum pattern duration from 1000 to 10000 frames
  - Minimum remains at 10 frames (default unchanged)
  - Allows for much longer pattern displays for extended viewing
  - Updated validation in FlowFieldRenderer to accept new range (10-10000)
  - Location: `src/components/PatternControls.tsx:306-319`
  - Location: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts:10969-10971`

### Technical Details

**Audio Context Connection Management:**

The fix implements a global WeakMap to track audio elements that have been connected to MediaElementSourceNodes:

```typescript
const connectedAudioElements = new WeakMap<
  HTMLAudioElement,
  {
    sourceNode: MediaElementAudioSourceNode;
    audioContext: AudioContext;
    analyser: AnalyserNode;
  }
>();
```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Connection Reuse**: When FlowFieldBackground remounts with the same audio element, it reuses the existing connection instead of attempting to create a new one
2. **Global Tracking**: WeakMap ensures connections persist across component unmounts/remounts
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Source nodes are never disconnected from audio elements (they can't be reconnected), only component refs are reset
4. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates all `InvalidStateError` exceptions related to audio context

**Authentication-Aware Query Execution:**

All track card components now check authentication before calling protected endpoints:

```typescript
const { data: session } = useSession();
const isAuthenticated = !!session;

const { data: favoriteData } = api.music.isFavorite.useQuery(
  { trackId: track.id },
  { enabled: showActions && isAuthenticated },
);
```

**Benefits:**

- Zero UNAUTHORIZED errors on public profile pages
- Reduced server load (no unnecessary failed queries)
- Cleaner console logs
- Better user experience (no error spam)
- Graceful degradation for unauthenticated users

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx` (audio context connection management)
- Modified: `src/components/EnhancedTrackCard.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/TrackCard.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/Player.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/PatternControls.tsx` (pattern duration range)
- Modified: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts` (pattern duration validation)
- Modified: `package.json` (version bump to 0.7.7)

### Stability Improvements Summary

This release focuses on **critical stability improvements** that eliminate errors and improve reliability:

1. **Visualizer Toggle Stability**: Users can now toggle the visualizer on/off without encountering errors or needing to reload the page
2. **Profile Page Stability**: Public profile pages load without generating hundreds of UNAUTHORIZED errors
3. **Error Reduction**: Eliminated all `InvalidStateError` and UNAUTHORIZED errors related to audio context and authentication
4. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls and error handling overhead
5. **User Experience**: Smoother interactions with no error spam in console logs

These fixes address fundamental stability issues that were causing user-facing errors and requiring page reloads.

  - Transaction-based batch processing for data integrity
  - Automatic conflict resolution (prevents duplicate inserts)

### Technical Details

**Migration Script Features:**

- **Table Discovery**: Automatically discovers all tables from source database
- **Dependency Ordering**: Uses topological sort to determine correct migration order based on foreign key relationships
- **Batch Processing**: Processes data in batches of 1000 rows for optimal performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with colored output showing:
  - Table being migrated
  - Row counts
  - Success/failure status
  - Total progress (X/17 tables)
- **Data Verification**: After migration, verifies row counts match between source and target

  - Migration order ensures foreign keys are respected
- **SSL Configuration**: Automatic SSL configuration for NEON connections
  - Detects NEON connection strings
  - Uses lenient SSL (rejectUnauthorized: false) for NEON
  - Supports custom CA certificates if needed

**Migration Process:**

1. **Pre-Migration Checks**:
   - Validates source and target database connections
   - Verifies schema exists on target database
   - Discovers all tables and counts rows
   - Shows migration summary before starting

2. **Migration Execution**:
   - Migrates tables in dependency order (parents before children)
   - Processes data in batches for performance
   - Handles JSONB columns with proper serialization
   - Skips rows with invalid JSON (logs warning, continues)
   - Resets sequences after each table

3. **Post-Migration Verification**:
   - Compares row counts between source and target
   - Reports any mismatches
   - Provides success confirmation

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Set target database URL
export TARGET_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@neon-host/db?sslmode=require"

# Run migration
npm run migrate:neon
```

  - Changed `NextRequest` import to `import type` for better tree-shaking
  - Added eslint disable comments for intentional img usage in edge runtime
  - Location: `src/app/api/og/route.tsx:4, 42`

### Technical Details

**PM2 Fork Mode Rationale:**

Next.js has built-in concurrency handling via Node.js async I/O. Cluster mode causes:

- Port binding conflicts (each instance tries to bind to same port)
- Excessive database connections (instances × pool size)
- Unnecessary complexity for Next.js architecture

Fork mode provides:

- Single optimized instance with automatic crash recovery
- Zero-downtime deployments via graceful reload
- Better resource utilization
- Simpler monitoring and debugging

**Shadow Realm Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
const layers = 18;
for (let layer = 0; layer < layers; layer++) {
  ctx.shadowBlur = baseShadowBlur;
  ctx.shadowColor = this.hsla(hue, 95, 40, 0.7);
  ctx.strokeStyle = this.hsla(hue, 85, avgLightness, avgAlpha);

  ctx.beginPath();
  for (let i = 0; i < segments; i++) {
    ctx.moveTo(x, y);
    ctx.arc(0, 0, radius, angle, nextAngle);
  }
  ctx.stroke();
}
```

**Infernal Flame Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
for (let layer = 0; layer < 2; layer++) {
  ctx.shadowBlur = layerShadowBlur;
  ctx.shadowColor = this.hsla(layerHue, 100, 70, 0.7);

  for (let flame = 0; flame < flames; flame++) {
    ctx.fillStyle = this.hsla(hueBase, 100, 70, flameAlpha);
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fill();
  }
}

for (let i = 0; i < emberCount; i++) {
  ctx.fillStyle = this.hsla(emberHue, 100, 80, emberAlpha);
  ctx.fillRect(baseX - halfSize, baseY - halfSize, emberSize, emberSize);
}
```

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `ecosystem.config.cjs` (fork mode optimization)
- Modified: `pm2-setup.sh` (updated process names and descriptions)
- Modified: `package.json` (version bump to 0.7.4, updated PM2 scripts)
- Modified: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts` (Shadow Realm + Infernal Flame optimizations)
- Modified: `src/app/api/og/route.tsx` (type imports and linting)

  - Location: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts:220-243, 1981-2112`

### Technical Details

**Fireworks Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
// Object pooling system
private fireworks: { x, y, vx, vy, hue, life, maxLife, size, dead }[] = [];
private fireworksPool: [...same structure...] = [];
private fireworksActiveCount = 0;
private fireworksCleanupCounter = 0;

// Mark particles dead instead of splice
if (fw.life > fw.maxLife) {
  fw.dead = true;
  this.fireworksActiveCount--;
  this.fireworksPool.push(fw);
  continue;
}

// Periodic cleanup every 120 frames
this.fireworksCleanupCounter++;
if (this.fireworksCleanupCounter > 120) {
  this.fireworksCleanupCounter = 0;
  this.fireworks = this.fireworks.filter((fw) => !fw.dead);
}

// Simplified rendering (no gradients)
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size, 0, TAU);        // Core
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size * 2, 0, TAU);    // Medium glow
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size * 3, 0, TAU);    // Outer glow
```

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

#### Critical Queue Bug #1: Partial Playlist Save (2, 4, 6 songs pattern)

- **Playlist Save Functionality**: Fixed severe bug where saving queue to playlist only saved partial tracks (2, 4, 6 pattern)
  - Root cause: Sequential `await` loop with potential race conditions
  - Changed from sequential execution to parallel `Promise.all` execution
  - Ensures **all tracks** are saved atomically without race conditions
  - Added detailed logging for each track being added (e.g., "Adding track 1/50: Song Title")
  - Location: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx:367-382`
  - Impact: Users can now reliably save their entire queue to playlists

#### Critical Queue Bug #2: Queue Destruction on Manual Play

- **Queue Preservation**: Fixed catastrophic bug where playing a new track manually **destroyed the entire queue**
  - Root cause: `setQueue([track])` completely replaced queue instead of inserting track
  - Impact: Users lost hours of work when manually playing a single track (100+ song queues gone instantly)
  - Fix: Changed to `setQueue([track, ...queue.slice(1)])` - inserts new track at position 0, preserves rest of queue
  - Queue behavior now:
    - If track **NOT** in queue: Inserts at position 0, shifts everything else down
    - If track **IN** queue: Moves it to position 0 (existing behavior)
    - **Your queue stays intact** - no more losing hours of curation work
  - Added comprehensive logging to track queue operations:
    - "Playing new track, inserting at queue position 0, preserving existing queue"
    - "Track already playing, restarting from beginning"
    - "Track found in queue at position X, playing from queue"
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1071-1085`

### Changed

#### Queue Resilience & Reliability

- **Queue Management**: Queue is now **much less brittle** and more robust
  - Manual track playback preserves existing queue
  - Playlist save operations are atomic and reliable
  - Enhanced logging throughout queue operations for debugging
  - Queue structure maintained: `queue[0]` = current track, `queue[1..n]` = upcoming tracks

### Technical Details

**Queue Structure:**

- Current track is always at `queue[0]`
- Upcoming tracks are at `queue[1..n]`
- History tracking works correctly with preserved queue

**Playlist Save Fix:**

```typescript
// OLD - Sequential, could have race conditions
for (const track of tracksToSave) {
  await addToPlaylistMutation.mutateAsync({ ... });
}

// NEW - All tracks added in parallel, atomic operation
await Promise.all(
  tracksToSave.map((track, index) => {
    console.log(`Adding track ${index + 1}/${tracksToSave.length}: ${track.title}`);
    return addToPlaylistMutation.mutateAsync({
      playlistId: playlist.id,
      track,
    });
  }),
);
```

**Queue Preservation Fix:**

```typescript
// OLD - DESTROYS the queue! 💀
setQueue([track]); // 100 carefully selected songs = GONE

// NEW - Preserves your precious queue! 🎉
setQueue([track, ...queue.slice(1)]); // Keep queue[1..n], replace queue[0]
```

### User Impact

**Before this fix:**

- Saving a 50-song queue to playlist might only save 2, 4, or 6 songs
- Playing a new track manually would wipe your entire 100+ song queue
- Users lost hours of work assembling queues

**After this fix:**

- All tracks in queue are reliably saved to playlists
- Playing new tracks preserves your carefully assembled queue
- Queue feels solid and reliable, not fragile and prone to destruction
